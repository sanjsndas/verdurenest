                <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the website owners. Cookies allow websites to recognize users and remember their preferences, such as login details, language settings, and other preferences. Without cookies, websites wouldn't be able to remember your preferences or provide personalized experiences. Cookies are not harmful and cannot carry viruses or install malware on your device.</p>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">2. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
                <p>We use several types of cookies on our website: Essential cookies that are necessary for the website to function properly; Performance cookies that collect information about how visitors use our site; Functionality cookies that remember choices you make; and Targeting cookies that collect information about your browsing habits. Each type serves a different purpose, ranging from making the website work properly to helping us understand how we can improve our services. Some cookies remain on your device only during your browsing session, while others persist for longer periods.</p>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">3. Essential Cookies</h2>
                <p>Essential cookies are strictly necessary for the operation of our website. They enable core functionality such as security, network management, and accessibility. These cookies don't collect information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you've been on the internet. Without these cookies, services you've asked for cannot be provided. For example, essential cookies allow you to navigate between pages efficiently, remember your cookie preferences, and maintain security. These cookies cannot be disabled as they are required for the website to function properly.</p>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">4. Performance Cookies</h2>
                <p>Performance cookies collect information about how visitors use our website, such as which pages are visited most often and if users receive error messages. These cookies don't collect information that identifies individual visitors - all information is aggregated and anonymous. We use these cookies to understand how our website is used so we can improve its functionality and user experience. The data helps us test different designs and ensure our pages load quickly and display properly. These cookies may be set by third-party services we use, such as Google Analytics.</p>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">5. Functionality Cookies</h2>
                <p>Functionality cookies allow our website to remember choices you make (such as your username, language preference, or region) and provide enhanced, more personalized features. These cookies may also be used to remember changes you've made to text size, fonts, and other customizable elements of web pages. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. Without these cookies, certain services you've asked for cannot be provided, and some website features may be less personalized and convenient.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">6. Targeting Cookies</h2>
                <p>Targeting cookies are used to deliver content that is more relevant to you and your interests. They may be used to deliver targeted advertising or to limit the number of times you see an advertisement. These cookies remember that you've visited our website and this information may be shared with other organizations such as advertisers. While these cookies can track your visits to our website, they cannot access other information on your computer. We use these cookies to make advertising more relevant to you and to measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">7. First-Party Cookies</h2>
                <p>First-party cookies are set by our website directly and can only be read by our site. We use these cookies to maintain your session when you log in to our website, remember your preferences, and provide you with a personalized experience. These cookies are essential for providing the services you've requested and for the website to operate as expected. First-party cookies are generally considered to be more secure than third-party cookies because they can't be accessed by other websites. We maintain strict control over these cookies and the data they collect.</p>

                <p>Third-party cookies are set by domains other than our website, typically by our partners and service providers. These cookies are used for various purposes including analytics, advertising, and social media integration. For example, we might use Google Analytics cookies to understand how our website is being used. Social media platforms may set cookies when you interact with their content on our site. These cookies allow the third parties to recognize your computer when you visit their websites or our website. We carefully select our third-party partners and require them to comply with applicable privacy laws.</p>

                <p>Session cookies are temporary cookies that remain on your device only until you close your browser. They are essential for the proper functioning of our website, particularly for maintaining your session and ensuring security. For example, session cookies allow you to navigate between pages without having to log in repeatedly. These cookies don't collect personal information from your computer and are automatically deleted when you end your browsing session. Session cookies are typically first-party cookies and are considered low risk in terms of privacy.</p>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">10. Persistent Cookies</h2>
                <p>Persistent cookies remain on your device for a set period specified in the cookie (from minutes to years) or until you delete them. We use persistent cookies to remember your preferences when you return to our website and to provide you with a personalized experience. For example, if you select "Remember Me" when logging in, a persistent cookie will store this preference. These cookies help us understand if you're a new visitor or a returning visitor, and allow us to track the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns over time.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">12. Cookie Duration</h2>
                <p>The duration for which a cookie remains on your device depends on whether it's a persistent or session cookie. Session cookies expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain until they expire or until you delete them. The expiration time for persistent cookies varies - some may expire after a few minutes while others may remain for several years. We regularly review the lifespan of our cookies and aim to keep retention periods to the minimum necessary for their purpose. You can delete cookies at any time through your browser settings.</p>

                <p>You can control and manage cookies in various ways, including through your browser settings. Most browsers allow you to view the cookies stored on your device, delete specific cookies, block cookies from particular sites, or block all cookies. However, please be aware that blocking all cookies may affect your ability to use our website and many others. Essential features may not work, and you may not be able to access certain parts of the site. Our cookie consent tool allows you to manage your preferences for non-essential cookies.</p>

                <p>To manage cookies in Chrome: Click the three-dot menu > Settings > Privacy and security > Cookies and other site data. In Firefox: Options > Privacy & Security > Cookies and Site Data. In Safari: Preferences > Privacy > Manage Website Data. In Edge: Settings > Cookies and site permissions > Manage and delete cookies.

Each browser provides different levels of control over cookies, with options to delete existing cookies, block future cookies, or set exceptions for specific websites. Browser manufacturers regularly update these controls, so check their support sites for the latest information.</p>

                <p>Cookies and similar technologies also work on mobile devices. Mobile browsers typically offer similar cookie management options to desktop browsers. Additionally, mobile operating systems may provide additional privacy controls at the system level. Some mobile apps also use cookies or similar technologies for similar purposes as websites. The exact controls available depend on your device and operating system version. You can usually find cookie controls in your mobile browser's settings menu, often under Privacy or Security settings. Some mobile devices allow you to manage cookies across all apps through system-wide privacy settings.</p>

                <p>Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that lets you tell websites you don't want to be tracked. Currently, our website doesn't respond to DNT signals because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted. However, we provide you with comprehensive cookie controls through our cookie consent tool. We respect your privacy preferences and will continue to monitor developments around DNT standards. In the meantime, you can use our cookie controls and your browser settings to manage tracking technologies.</p>
