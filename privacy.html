                <p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on our website, express an interest in our services, participate in activities, or otherwise contact us. This may include your name, email address, phone number, mailing address, payment information, and any other details you choose to provide. We also automatically collect certain technical data when you visit our website, such as your IP address, browser type, device characteristics, and usage patterns through cookies and similar technologies.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>We use the information we collect to provide, maintain, and improve our services; process transactions; communicate with you; personalize your experience; prevent fraud; and comply with legal obligations. Specifically, we may use your email address to send you service-related notices, marketing communications, and updates about your account. We analyze usage data to understand how our services are accessed and used, which helps us improve functionality and develop new features. Your information may also be used for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="policy-point">
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
                <p>We may share your personal information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, and customer service. These providers are contractually obligated to keep your information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them. We may also disclose information if required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</p>

                <p>We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track activity on our website and hold certain information. Cookies are files with a small amount of data which may include an anonymous unique identifier. They are sent to your browser from a website and stored on your device. We use both session cookies (which expire once you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your device until you delete them) to provide and improve our services. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent, but if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our site.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">5. Data Security</h2>
                <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of your personal information. We use encryption for data in transit and at rest, regular security audits, and access controls to prevent unauthorized access to our systems. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We encourage you to use strong passwords, keep your login credentials confidential, and be cautious about the information you share in public areas of the website.</p>

                <p>We will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our policies. When we no longer need to process your personal information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, we will delete your data from our systems or anonymize it so that it can no longer be associated with you.</p>

                <p>Our services are not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us so we can take necessary action. Parents or legal guardians can review, request modifications to, or request deletion of a child's personal information.</p>

                <p>Your information, including personal data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those of your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including personal data, to the United States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

If you are a California resident, you have the right to request information about our collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information over the past 12 months, and ask that we delete your personal information.

                <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These include the right to access, rectify, or erase your personal data, the right to restrict or object to processing, and the right to data portability. Where we process your personal data based on your consent, you may withdraw that consent at any time. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in your country of residence.

                <p>For our clients and partners who are subject to GDPR requirements, we offer a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) that outlines our respective roles and responsibilities regarding the processing of personal data. The DPA incorporates the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission for international data transfers outside the EEA. Our DPA specifies the technical and organizational measures we implement to ensure an appropriate level of security relative to the risk, including measures to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access.</p>

                <p>Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets you tell websites you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Our website does not currently respond to Do Not Track signals from web browsers because no uniform standard for recognizing and implementing these signals has been adopted. However, we offer you control over the collection and use of your personal information through our cookie settings and privacy preferences. You can change your browser settings to block cookies or alert you when cookies are being sent to your device, though this may affect your ability to access certain parts of our website.</p>

                <p>In the event that VerdureNest is involved in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal information may be among the assets transferred. We will notify you via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information. Any successor entity will continue to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended, and we will take reasonable steps to ensure the protection of your personal information throughout the transfer process.</p>

If you wish to delete or deactivate your account, please email us, but note that we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.

                <p>We collect and process your personal information only where we have legal bases for doing so. These legal bases depend on the services you use and how you use them, meaning we collect and use your information only where it's necessary for the performance of a contract with you (such as when you purchase our services), compliance with our legal obligations, legitimate interests (such as improving our services, marketing, and preventing fraud), or your consent (which you may withdraw at any time). Where we rely on your consent to process personal information, we will provide you with clear notice and an opportunity to withdraw your consent at any time. If you have any questions about the legal bases on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us.
